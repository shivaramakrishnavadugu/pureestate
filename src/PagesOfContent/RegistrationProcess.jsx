            <h1>Registration Process</h1>
            <p><span>Document Verification:</span> Before initiating the registration process, it's essential to verify all property-related documents, including the sale deed, title deed, encumbrance certificate, and other relevant documents. Ensure that the seller has clear ownership rights and that the property is free from any legal encumbrances.</p>

            <p><span>Stamp Duty Payment:</span> Pay the required stamp duty based on the property's value and location. Stamp duty rates vary across states and are usually calculated as a percentage of the property's sale value. Stamp duty payment is mandatory for property registration and must be done before submitting the registration application.</p>

            <p><span>Visit Sub-Registrar's Office:</span> Visit the local sub-registrar's office within whose jurisdiction the property is located. The buyer, seller, and two witnesses must be present at the sub-registrar's office for registration.</p>

            <p><span>Submit Application Form:</span> Obtain the prescribed application form for property registration from the sub-registrar's office. Fill out the application form with accurate details and attach necessary documents, including proof of identity, address proof, sale deed, and other required documents.</p>

            <p><span>Biometric Verification and Photographs:</span> Under the Aadhaar-based authentication system, both the buyer and seller need to undergo biometric verification (fingerprints and iris scans) at the sub-registrar's office. Additionally, photographs of the parties involved will be taken.</p>

            <p><span>Registration Fee Payment:</span> Pay the registration fees as prescribed by the state government. Registration fees are separate from stamp duty and cover the administrative costs associated with property registration.</p>

            <p><span>Document Execution and Attestation:</span> The buyer and seller must sign the sale deed or conveyance deed in the presence of the sub-registrar or an authorized officer. The deed is attested by the sub-registrar after verifying the documents and ensuring compliance with legal requirements.</p>

            <p><span>Document Stamping and Registration:</span> After document execution, the sale deed is stamped with the appropriate stamp duty value and registered in the government's records. The sub-registrar assigns a unique registration number to the property and updates the records accordingly.</p>

            <p><span>Receipt of Registration Certificate:</span> Upon successful registration, the buyer receives a registration certificate as proof of property ownership. The registration certificate includes details such as the property's registration number, buyer and seller details, property description, and transaction value.</p>

            <p><span>Obtain Encumbrance Certificate:</span> After registration, the buyer can obtain an encumbrance certificate from the sub-registrar's office. The encumbrance certificate confirms that the property is free from any encumbrances or legal liabilities.</p>

            <p><span>Update Records:</span> The registration details are updated in the land records maintained by the local land registry or revenue department. The buyer's name is reflected as the new owner of the property in the records.</p>

            <p>It's important to note that the property registration process may vary slightly depending on the state laws and regulations. It's advisable to seek guidance from a qualified legal advisor or property consultant to ensure compliance with all legal requirements and smooth completion of the registration process.</p>
