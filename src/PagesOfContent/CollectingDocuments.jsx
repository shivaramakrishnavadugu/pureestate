            <p>After property registration in India, several documents are issued to the buyer as proof of ownership and legal compliance. Here are the key documents you should receive after property registration:</p>

            <p><span>Sale Deed:</span> The sale deed is the primary document that transfers ownership of the property from the seller to the buyer. It contains details such as the buyer and seller's names, property description, sale consideration, and terms of the transaction. The sale deed is signed by both parties and attested by the sub-registrar during registration.</p>

            <p><span>Registration Certificate:</span> The registration certificate is issued by the sub-registrar's office after the property registration process is completed. It serves as official proof that the property has been registered in the buyer's name and includes details such as the registration number, buyer and seller details, property description, and transaction value.</p>

            <p><span>Encumbrance Certificate:</span> An encumbrance certificate is obtained from the sub-registrar's office and confirms that the property is free from any encumbrances or legal liabilities. It provides a record of all transactions and transactions affecting the property for a specified period, usually up to 30 years.</p>

            <p><span>Possession Letter:</span> If the property is ready for possession at the time of registration, the seller may issue a possession letter to the buyer confirming that they have handed over possession of the property. The possession letter typically includes details such as the date of possession and any conditions related to possession.</p>

            <p><span>Original Title Deeds:</span> The buyer should receive the original title deeds from the seller after registration. These documents serve as proof of the seller's ownership rights and are essential for future reference or legal purposes.</p>

            <p><span>Tax Receipts:</span> The buyer should obtain copies of property tax receipts from the seller as proof that property taxes have been paid up to date. Property tax receipts are important for maintaining compliance with local tax regulations.</p>

            <p><span>Mutation Certificate:</span> In some states, a mutation certificate or extract may be issued after property registration. This document updates the revenue records to reflect the new owner's name and details of the property transaction.</p>

            <p><span>No Objection Certificates (NOCs):</span> If applicable, the buyer may receive NOCs from relevant authorities such as the society or association, municipal corporation, pollution control board, fire department, etc. These certificates confirm that the property complies with all regulatory requirements.</p>

            <p><span>Loan Documents (if applicable):</span> If the property is financed through a home loan, the buyer will receive loan documents from the lender, including the loan agreement, sanction letter, mortgage deed, and other related documents.</p>

            <p>It's important to carefully review and retain these documents in a safe place for future reference and legal purposes. Additionally, it's advisable to consult with a legal advisor or property expert to ensure that all necessary documents are obtained and properly verified after property registration.</p>
