            <p><span>Consult Legal Experts:</span> Seek guidance from legal experts such as property lawyers or real estate attorneys. They can help you understand the legal aspects related to property ownership and identify any restrictions or prohibitions associated with the property.</p>

            <p><span>Verify Property Documents:</span> Review all property documents carefully, including sale deeds, title deeds, and land records. Look for any clauses or annotations that indicate restrictions imposed by the government or any other legal entities.</p>

            <p><span>Check Government Websites:</span> Many state governments in India provide online portals for accessing land records and property information. You can visit the respective state's land records website and search for the property by its survey number or address. These records often contain details about the property's status, ownership, and any encumbrances.</p>

            <p><span>Visit Sub-Registrar's Office:</span> Visit the sub-registrar's office in the jurisdiction where the property is located. They maintain records of property transactions, including details about any legal restrictions or prohibitions associated with the property.</p>

            <p><span>Verify with Local Authorities:</span> Contact local municipal authorities or planning departments to inquire about any zoning regulations, land use restrictions, or environmental prohibitions that may affect the property.</p>

            <p><span>Search for Litigation Records:</span> Check if there are any pending legal disputes or litigations related to the property. You can search online databases or visit the district court to obtain information about any ongoing legal proceedings.</p>

            <p><span>Consult Property Developers or Agents:</span> If you're considering purchasing property from a developer or through a real estate agent, inquire about the property's legal status and any potential restrictions before making any commitments.</p>

            <p><span>Physical Inspection:</span> Conduct a physical inspection of the property to assess its condition and surroundings. Look for any signs of government notices, encroachments, or other factors that may indicate legal restrictions.</p>

            <p>It's crucial to conduct thorough due diligence and seek professional assistance to ensure that the property you're interested in doesn't have any prohibitions or legal issues that could affect your ownership rights in the future.</p>
